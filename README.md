# EinsatzScan
Lua file stealer for Garry's Mod. Of course, it is steals only clientside and shared files. **The EinsatzScan cannot be detected** by all Garry's Mod anti-cheats and by any other way via lua.

## Additional information
The EinsatzScan writes data to a special folder (**/Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod_ES/-server-/**).\
The EinsatzScan steals files with correct folder structure.\
The EinsatzScan can steal non-file lua execution. Found stuff is written to **/engine_calls/** folder of server.

## How to use?
This DLL is for injection into Garry's Mod process.\
The injector doesn't matter, so you can just use Cheat Engine for your purposes.\
You DON'T need to put the DLL to a Garry's Mod folder!\
Inject it, when you are in main menu, and now you can connect to the server.
